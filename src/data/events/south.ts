 Three players, one life. Will you be the last team standing?

Frostbite isn’t the only thing that bites in the SantaCraft Survival Games. This is a tactical, high-stakes arena where individual skill takes a backseat to team coordination. If your teammate falls, your chances of victory vanish.

🌟Tactical Survival: Scavenge, gear up, and hold the high ground in a custom winter arena.

🌟Protect the Partner: Success is measured by how well you cover each other's backs. Flank, distraction, and rescue maneuvers are the keys to the crown.
